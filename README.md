# Commuting-distance-by-occupation

This repository facilitates the process of generating insight from Australian Commuting distance data. Specifically the software in this repository describes how we identified : “Sales workers have a relatively lower daily commuting distance (12.6km) compared to other occupations in Australia in 2016.”. 

The Australian Commuting distance data was collected from ABS-Commuting-Distance-by-Personal-Characteristics (10.5281/zenodo.4939860)  Zenodo repository that it contains information about  distance travelled between a person's place of usual residence and place of work associated with personal characteristics. We created a Jupyter Notebook called “prepare_and_setup.ipynb” to read this data and extract insight by using Python code.
